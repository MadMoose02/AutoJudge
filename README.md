## Scope and Purpose of AutoJudge
This project is an **Auto**mated **Judge** System that is intended to assist lecturers, tutors, and other
such persons with grading student assignment submissions. Submissions will be analysed by AutoJudge 
in batches as a compressed zip file. For each source file, accurate Java syntax and adherence to programming 
paradigms will be assessed. After all source files have been analysed, a PDF report is generated with an 
overall score and constructive feedback
